\maketitle

\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
feedback.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board)
Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

\plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

\plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

\subsection{SRS and Hazard Analysis}

\subsection{Design and Design Documentation}

\subsection{VnV Plan and Report}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11)}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your 
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could 
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to 
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an 
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential 
users currently exist?}

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and 
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

\plt{What will you do differently for your next project?}
