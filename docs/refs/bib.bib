	abstract = {Inertial sensors based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, such as accelerometers and angular rate sensors, are cost-eﬀective solutions used in inertial navigation systems in a broad spectrum of applications that estimate position, velocity and orientation of a system with respect to an inertial reference frame. Although they present several advantages in terms of cost and form factor, they are prone to various disturbances such as noise, biases, and random walk that degrade their orientation estimation. The task of an orientation ﬁlter is to compute an optimal solution for the attitude state, consisting of roll, pitch and yaw, through the fusion of angular rate, accelerometer, and magnetometer measurements, regardless of the underlying environmental constraints. The aim of this paper is threefold: ﬁrst, it serves researchers and practitioners in the signal processing community seeking the most appropriate attitude estimators that fulﬁlls their needs, shedding light on the drawbacks and the advantages of a wide variety of designs. Second, it serves as a survey and tutorial for existing estimator designs in the literature, assessing their design aspects and components, and dissecting their hidden details for the beneﬁt of researchers. Third, a comprehensive list of algorithms is discussed for a fully functional inertial navigation system, starting from the navigation equations and ending with the ﬁlter equations, keeping in mind their suitability for powerlimited embedded processors. The source code of all algorithms is published, with the aim of it being an outof-box solution for researchers in the ﬁeld. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand the key concepts of an inertial navigation system; be able to implement and test a complete stand alone solution; be able to evaluate and understand diﬀerent algorithms; understand the trade-oﬀs between diﬀerent ﬁlter architectures and techniques; and understand eﬃcient embedded processing techniques, trends and opportunities.},

	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation ﬁlter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The ﬁlter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The beneﬁts of the ﬁlter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each ﬁlter update, (2) eﬀective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters deﬁned by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the ﬁlter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

ABSTRACT = {Inertial measurement units (IMUs) enable orientation, velocity, and position estimation in several application domains ranging from robotics and autonomous vehicles to human motion capture and rehabilitation engineering. Errors in orientation estimation greatly affect any of those motion parameters. The present work explains the main challenges in inertial orientation estimation (IOE) and presents an extensive benchmark dataset that includes 3D inertial and magnetic data with synchronized optical marker-based ground truth measurements, the Berlin Robust Orientation Estimation Assessment Dataset (BROAD). The BROAD dataset consists of 39 trials that are conducted at different speeds and include various types of movement. Thereof, 23 trials are performed in an undisturbed indoor environment, and 16 trials are recorded with deliberate magnetometer and accelerometer disturbances. We furthermore propose error metrics that allow for IOE accuracy evaluation while separating the heading and inclination portions of the error and introduce well-defined benchmark metrics. Based on the proposed benchmark, we perform an exemplary case study on two widely used openly available IOE algorithms. Due to the broad range of motion and disturbance scenarios, the proposed benchmark is expected to provide valuable insight and useful tools for the assessment, selection, and further development of inertial sensor fusion methods and IMU-based application systems.},
