\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing software.  A module
is a work assignment for a programmer or programming team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a
decomposition based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This principle
supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module hides represent likely future
changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC, where modifications are frequent, especially during
initial development as the solution space is explored.

Our design follows the from \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the secrets of separate
  modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data structures must obtain
  it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), the
Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG specifies the modular structure of the
system and is intended to allow both designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the
software.  The potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member to easily
  understand the overall structure and quickly find the relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the maintainers'
  understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is important for a maintainer to
  update the relevant sections of the document after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to check for consistency,
  feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the system in various ways, such as consistency
  among modules, feasibility of the decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section \ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and
unlikely changes of the software requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module
decomposition that was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the modules. Section \ref{SecMD}
gives a detailed description of the modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices.
One checks the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The other
shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section \ref{SecUse} describes the
use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness of the change, the
possible changes are classified into two categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section
\ref{SecAchange}, and unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden inside the modules.
Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only require changing the one module that
hides the associated decision. The approach adapted here is called design for change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{lc:gyro}:] Add online gyroscope bias compensation.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{lc:mag}:] Add magnetic disturbance compensation.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is more complex.
Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design decisions at the system architecture
stage can simplify the software design. Currently, there are no unlikely changes.

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized in a hierarchy
decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed below, which are leaves in the
hierarchy tree, are the modules that will actually be implemented.

\begin{description}
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:mm}:] Math Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:mmm}:] Matrix Math Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:qm}:] Quaternion Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:ivm}:] Input Verification Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:iqwomm}:] Accel To Quat
Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:iqwmm}:] Mag To Quat Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:ewomm}:] Estimate w/o Mag Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:ewmm}:] Estimate w Mag Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{m:cm}:] Control Module

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in the SRS. In this
stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection between requirements and modules is
listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made ``between'' the
  requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements, design decisions need to be made.
  Rather than make these decisions implicit, they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a
  program has security requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding'' proposed by
\citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module decomposition is a brief statement of
the design decision hidden by the module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module
will do without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the implementing
software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the entry is \emph{OS}, this means that
the module is provided by the operating system or by standard programming language libraries.
\emph{\progname{}} means the module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this
means that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two
programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete
the task described in its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct implementation of B.  Figure
\ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler because they use
modules from the lower levels.
