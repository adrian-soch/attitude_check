	abstract = {Inertial sensors based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, such as accelerometers and angular rate sensors, are cost-eﬀective solutions used in inertial navigation systems in a broad spectrum of applications that estimate position, velocity and orientation of a system with respect to an inertial reference frame. Although they present several advantages in terms of cost and form factor, they are prone to various disturbances such as noise, biases, and random walk that degrade their orientation estimation. The task of an orientation ﬁlter is to compute an optimal solution for the attitude state, consisting of roll, pitch and yaw, through the fusion of angular rate, accelerometer, and magnetometer measurements, regardless of the underlying environmental constraints. The aim of this paper is threefold: ﬁrst, it serves researchers and practitioners in the signal processing community seeking the most appropriate attitude estimators that fulﬁlls their needs, shedding light on the drawbacks and the advantages of a wide variety of designs. Second, it serves as a survey and tutorial for existing estimator designs in the literature, assessing their design aspects and components, and dissecting their hidden details for the beneﬁt of researchers. Third, a comprehensive list of algorithms is discussed for a fully functional inertial navigation system, starting from the navigation equations and ending with the ﬁlter equations, keeping in mind their suitability for powerlimited embedded processors. The source code of all algorithms is published, with the aim of it being an outof-box solution for researchers in the ﬁeld. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand the key concepts of an inertial navigation system; be able to implement and test a complete stand alone solution; be able to evaluate and understand diﬀerent algorithms; understand the trade-oﬀs between diﬀerent ﬁlter architectures and techniques; and understand eﬃcient embedded processing techniques, trends and opportunities.},
