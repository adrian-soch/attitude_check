This file is entirely capstone specific.  (It would not exist in a project
outside the context of this course.)  If your project is not suited to the
standard template for folder structure and naming, you should discuss this with
the course instructor.  Assuming an exception is granted, you should record the
details of the exception in this file.  This will allow the TAs and course
instructor to quickly review the exceptions, especially in advance of grading.
